## Overall Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ / 5  

## Review Summary  
Donkey is very quiet in class but vocal on EdStem! Will wrestly you for the 5
cents you owed him in grade 1.

## Detailed Breakdown  

- **Learning Style:** Ninja learner, asks probing questions on Edstem.
- **Grades:** Could be better (not counting his 0.01% grdde debt).
- **Workload & Difficulty:** Will fight for 0.01% of the grade! He has earned
it fair and square..
