## Overall Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ / 5  

## Review Summary  
Donkey has been carrying load all across Mordor! Has been struggling under the
weight of lab1, lab2, lab3, lab4... they're relentless. Donkey tired!

## Detailed Breakdown  

- **Learning Style:** Quietly slips in from the right and will duck out for
water.
- **Grades:** Could be better
- **Workload & Difficulty:** Sincere and hard working donkey. Will get the job
done.
- **Engagement & Helpfulness:** Always ready with markers and accoutrements for
learning (I think I am not mixing up faces :P). 
- **Donkey Quality:** Mordor's most evil
