## Overall Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ / 5  

## Review Summary  
Donkey has been spotted sporadically in lectures trying to avoid the mericless
glare of Sauron!

## Detailed Breakdown  

- **Learning Style:** Absolutely plugged in! Will ask ridiculously talented
questions despite not sitting in the front row. 
- **Grades:** Could be better
- **Workload & Difficulty:** Seems to be doing well and creates no ruckus in
class.
- **Engagement & Helpfulness:** Engagment level 100/100! Classes would be boring
without the left half being active.
- **Donkey Quality:** Vaughn's slimiest
