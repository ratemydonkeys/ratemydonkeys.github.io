## Overall Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ / 5  

## Review Summary  
Donkey will get to the bottom of all concepts and ideas and report bugs in
lecture slide content that has gone unchallenged by years of donkey trainees who apparently didn't care enough to report them. 

## Detailed Breakdown  

- **Learning Style:** Class first-principles investigator. If you want to get to
bottom of a mystery, this is the donkey you hire!
- **Grades:** Could be better
- **Workload & Difficulty:** Does't complain too much about the massive 327
workload. But gets super excited about difficult labs :P
- **Engagement & Helpfulness:**  Not the loudest donkey in class, but easily one of the more impactful... slides revisions, concept challenges, etc
- **Donkey Quality:** Detective in the making...
