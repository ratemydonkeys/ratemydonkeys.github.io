## Overall Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ / 5  

## Review Summary  
Donkey apparently loves Quantum, and has the most inquisitive and spotaneously
combustible brain chemistry known to donkeyland..

## Detailed Breakdown  

- **Learning Style:** Cannot stop asking questions! There's an endless supply of
questions. Seems to help cement ideas in donkey's brain.
- **Grades:** Could be better
- **Workload & Difficulty:** Seems to handle any task thrown at him. No mountain
is too hard for this donkey to climb.
- **Engagement & Helpfulness:**  Asks only the most difficult questions! Makes connections to wildest other concepts and free-associates at will.
- **Donkey Quality:** Donkey is in a superposition of machine learning,
    digital hardware, and quantum computing.
