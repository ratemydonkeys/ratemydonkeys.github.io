## Overall Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ / 5  

## Review Summary  
Donkey loves cooking. Apparently has a favorite lentil + mayonnaise dish that is
the talk of town. Also indulges in delicacies such as raw potato and boild eggs.

## Detailed Breakdown  

- **Learning Style:** Mostly quiet but will get stuff done. Especially his URA wokr, no idea about 327 honestly.
- **Grades:** Could be better.
- **Workload & Difficulty:** Manages to do reasonably well in ECE327 as well as his URA! 
- **Engagement & Helpfulness:** Quiet donkey makes no noise. But will suddently ask crazy smart questions.
- **Donkey Quality:** Michelin Chef
