## Overall Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ / 5  

## Review Summary  
Donkey is a teacher's pet! Wise beyond his years and peers... always has
measured, carefully crafted and thought-through responses. Asks great questions.

## Detailed Breakdown  

- **Learning Style:** Incredibly inquizitive and will want to know how everything works.
- **Grades:** Could be better.
- **Workload & Difficulty:** Seems to be able to put different hats on with ease. 
- **Engagement & Helpfulness:** Front-row seat indictes high engagement! Very insighful commentary.
- **Donkey Quality:** Destined for European aristocracy
