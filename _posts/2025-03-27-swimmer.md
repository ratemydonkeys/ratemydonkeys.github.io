## Overall Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ / 5  

## Review Summary  
Donkey is a Desmos-loving swim champion who skips Friday lectures for swim
meets.

## Detailed Breakdown  

- **Learning Style:** Sits closest to the exit with one foot out, but seems to be paying attention all the time :P
- **Grades:** Couldn't be any better.
- **Workload & Difficulty:** Everything is converted into a Desmos program! Writes Verilog in Desmos. 
- **Engagement & Helpfulness:** Glued to the lectures! Will catch every mistake you make.
- **Donkey Quality:** Burlington's Jim Carrey
