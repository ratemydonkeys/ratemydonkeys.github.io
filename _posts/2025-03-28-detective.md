## Overall Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ / 5  

## Review Summary  
If there's a mystery to solve this is the donkey to hire! Donkey will find mysteries where none exist, and has now done it twice in 720t7 and 327! How he unearths these bugs that only he suffers from is a mystery to me :P

## Detailed Breakdown  

- **Learning Style:** There's a mystery to solve in every class artifact. Will battle test your ideas in a unique way to learn new knowledge even Prof Donkey doesn't know.
- **Grades:** Could be better.
- **Workload & Difficulty:** Easy problems are made harder and new knowledge is invented from seemingly irrelevant details! Absolutely glorious discoveries!
- **Engagement & Helpfulness:** Great TA material! Can engage with content and stress test everything for you in all possibl angles!
- **Donkey Quality:** Hardware Sherlock Holmes!
