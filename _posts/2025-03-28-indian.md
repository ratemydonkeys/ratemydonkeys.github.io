## Overall Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ / 5  

## Review Summary  
Odd Donkey that accidentally entered the ECE327 class one day and decided to stay. Wildly excited about systolic arrays and enjoys masochistic fun.

## Detailed Breakdown  

- **Learning Style:** If there something to learn, this donkey immediately shows up with his notebook and pencil.
- **Grades:** Could be better.
- **Workload & Difficulty:** Keeps things until it is too late and livestreams his development effort. It is a miracle that he manages to get things done.
- **Engagement & Helpfulness:** Donkey doesn't sit in the front row phsically, but in his mind he's always in the front row all the time!
- **Donkey Quality:** Future CEO of Intel
