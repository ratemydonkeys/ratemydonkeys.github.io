## Overall Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ / 5  

## Review Summary  
An extrememly tiny nano donkey that signed up for this class at the last minute!! Loves to shrink circuits down in size and can be seen reducing LUTs, DSPs, and BRAMs down to nano dimensions!

## Detailed Breakdown  

- **Learning Style:** Mostly quiet but will not hesitate to chirp in if needed.
- **Grades:** Could be better.
- **Workload & Difficulty:** Not the worst at managing workload, but could definitely plan things better.
- **Engagement & Helpfulness:** Can vouch for attentiveness during lectures! Gears can be seen and heard spinning inside donkey's brains!
- **Donkey Quality:** Quiet Intellectual.
