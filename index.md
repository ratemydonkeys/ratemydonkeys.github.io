**Number of donkeys:** [~170]  
**Semester/Year:** [Winter, 2025]  

## Overall Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ / 5  

## Review Summary  
Donkeys seem to want to haul their lab load only at the last minute.. mere days before the deadline! Some donkeys didn't even wait until end of term before passing premature judgement on uwflow, why??!

## Detailed Breakdown  

- **Learning Style:** [Donkeys are usually asking confusing OR-style questions and expect non-digital answers?! What?]  
- **Grades:** [Donkeys are doing well this year especially as the climb is uphill against constant Policy 71 threats. ]  
- **Workload & Difficulty:** [They flood Edstem watering holes with lots of questions at the same time, sometimes asking the same question!]  
- **Engagement & Helpfulness:** [There is a group of elite donkeys that listen to each lecture, but attendance this year has been abysmal!]  
- **Donkey Quality:** [I fully believe these are Canada's best donkeys!]  

## Final Thoughts  
10/10 would teach them again.
